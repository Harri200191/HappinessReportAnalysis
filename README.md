# World Happiness Report Analysis (2015)

The data set being used in this project was taken off from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unsdsn/world-happiness?datasetId=894&sortBy=voteCount). Basically the dataset contains certain parameters that include:

1. Life Expectancy
2. Generousity
3. GDP per Capita
4. Freedom of Speech

Based on these, I used Plotly express to create interactive offline graphs that center around these parameters and have been colour coded differently just like a heatmap. A colour key on the side enables us to analyze which country has extremes of each of the parameters mentioned above. This process was repeated for the years 2015 to 2019 included. The same solution has also been uploaded on Kaggle for those who want to see, click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/harisrehmanhh/world-happiness)
